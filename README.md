# LeftJS

`LeftJS` is a clean take on the [RightJS](http://rightjs.org) framework

It is not a fork, it is more like R&D for the future major version of
RightJS. The goal is to play with some new ideas in a clean environment.

The targets are the following:

 * Get rid of all the global variables
 * Make no JavaScript core extensions (will go in a plugin)
 * Create a console based testing/building environment
 * Make more civilized collections handling interface
 * Review the utility functions collection
 * Focus on the modern browsers: Safari, Chrome, FF4
 * Zero tolerance for old browser hacks in the core

Basically the aim is to create a super-lightweight and clean version of
RightJS and see where it will get us.
