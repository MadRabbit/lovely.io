# Lovely IO

`Lovely IO` is a javascript development platform based on [RightJS](http://rightjs.org)
It is not exactly a framework, but rather a collection of micro-frameworks
based on modules from [RightJS](http://rightjs.org)

The goal of the project is to create a platform/environment for JavaScript
development that will help you to have grand old time while you do your job

The targets are about the following

 * Real modularity
 * AMD based modules serving
 * Automatic dependencies handling
 * Community available hosting

Well, kinda like that.
Watch for the actual release :)

    npm install coffee-script vows jshint uglify-js express zombie

After that just run one of those

    cake build
    cake test
