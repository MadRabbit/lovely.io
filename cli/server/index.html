    <p>
      Greetings my dear friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you see this page, then it probably means that you have indeed
      successfully created a lovely project and launched a lovely server.
      Congratulations on that!
    </p>
    <p>
      But, it seems you didn't have the <tt>/index.html</tt> page in your
      project directory, so I took the liberty and served you one from
      my own stash of shared resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look into the <tt>~/.lovely/server/</tt> folder when you have a moment.
      You will find this and some other pages over there, which you might
      want to use in your projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      --<br/>
      Sincerely Yours,<br/>
      Lovely Server
