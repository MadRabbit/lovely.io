# Development Server Content

This folder contains a simple collections of shared static
content that can be used with the development server

## How it works

Just hook any of the files in this directory as if they were
in your package folder root.

__NOTE__: if some files in your package folder have the same
name as any of files in this directory, then your stuff will
be served
